My name is Emily Keen. I grew up in Peachtree City. I attended Georgia Tech and graduated in 2013. After college I moved out to Plano, Texas to work for Capital One. I worked at Capital One until Decemeber 2016. I married my husband, Tommy Keen, in 2015 after seven years of dating. I am now a stay-at-home mom to my pets and attending the Georgia Tech Coding Boot Camp to transition my carrer from hardware to software. My favorite food is pizza. I enjoy watching the news and keeping up with important events domestic and international. </p>
